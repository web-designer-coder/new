<section id="about">
    <h2>About Our E-Waste Management Platform</h2>
    <p>Our platform is designed to tackle the growing global problem of electronic waste (e-waste). We provide a convenient solution for individuals and businesses to responsibly dispose of their electronic devices, preventing harmful materials from entering landfills and contributing to environmental degradation.</p>
    
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>We are committed to reducing the environmental impact of e-waste through sustainable practices. Our goal is to promote the recycling, refurbishment, and reuse of electronic products, minimizing the need for new raw materials and supporting a circular economy. By raising awareness and offering easy-to-use services, we aim to make e-waste disposal accessible to everyone.</p>
    
    <h3>Why E-Waste Management Matters</h3>
    <p>Electronic waste is the fastest-growing waste stream globally, and it poses a serious threat to both the environment and human health. E-waste contains toxic materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can leach into soil and water sources when improperly disposed of. Recycling and properly handling e-waste not only helps prevent environmental contamination but also allows for the recovery of valuable resources such as gold, silver, copper, and rare earth elements.</p>

    <h3>How We Help</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Convenient Pickup Services:</strong> Our platform allows users to schedule e-waste pickups from their homes or offices, making it easy to dispose of old electronics without leaving your location.</li>
        <li><strong>Drop-Off Locations:</strong> We provide information on nearby e-waste collection points for those who prefer to drop off their devices for recycling.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Tracking:</strong> Users can track the amount of e-waste they have contributed and see how their actions are helping reduce global e-waste.</li>
        <li><strong>Rewards and Incentives:</strong> We encourage responsible e-waste disposal by offering rewards that can be redeemed for discounts, cashback, or other incentives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>We envision a world where e-waste is no longer a burden on the environment. By integrating sustainable e-waste management practices into everyday life, we believe we can drive significant change towards a greener future. We aim to build a global community that is informed, responsible, and proactive about e-waste, ensuring that every electronic device is either reused, refurbished, or recycled.</p>

        <h3 class="collapsible-header">What is E-Waste?</h3>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>E-Waste, or electronic waste, refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices. This includes old computers, mobile phones, televisions, refrigerators, and other devices that have reached the end of their useful life. If improperly disposed of, e-waste can be harmful to the environment due to the presence of toxic substances like lead, mercury, and cadmium.</p>

        <h3 class="collapsible-header">The Importance of E-Waste Recycling</h3>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>Recycling e-waste is critical for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> E-waste often contains hazardous materials that, if improperly disposed of, can harm ecosystems and human health. Recycling ensures these toxic substances are handled responsibly.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Conservation:</strong> Many electronic devices contain precious metals like gold, silver, and copper, which can be recovered and reused, reducing the need for mining new materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Waste Reduction:</strong> By recycling e-waste, we reduce the volume of waste going to landfills, conserving space and reducing pollution.</li>

    <!-- Circular Economy Concept -->

        <h3 class="collapsible-header">Understanding the Circular Economy</h3>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>The circular economy is an economic model that aims to minimize waste and make the most of resources. In contrast to the traditional linear economy—which follows a 'take, make, dispose' model—the circular economy encourages reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products. This approach helps to extend the life cycle of products and reduce environmental impact.</p>

        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>In the circular economy model, e-waste plays a crucial role in promoting sustainability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recycling Materials:</strong> E-waste contains valuable materials that can be recovered and reintroduced into the manufacturing process.</li>
                <li><strong>Refurbishment and Reuse:</strong> Many electronic devices can be repaired and reused, extending their lifespan and reducing the need for new products.</li>
                <li><strong>Reducing Resource Extraction:</strong> By recycling and reusing materials, we reduce the demand for extracting new raw materials from the Earth, helping to conserve natural resources.</li>
